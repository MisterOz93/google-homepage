This is my first project! Recreating the google front page. Good luck me!

Some of the Things I learned:

<span> Wow so useful! basically <div> without breaking things up.
&nbsp; Also very useful! Adding a space wherever 
Getting a lot better at basic syntax/layout. 
Super important that <span> is inline, and so for stuff like text-align to work
in it I have to display: block; in css. Need to read up on inline. 
class="" is my new best friend.
scratch that, float: is my new best friend.
